## Statham

A json toolkit, ready for battle.

Not inspired by [this tweet](https://x.com/supabase/status/1802725436675211526?t=7ynINgqIO8N0_VxHTE511Q&s=08) but funnily enough I cam across it while building it.

Other json libraries focus on json (de-)serialization, whereas this one is focused on schema description and backwards compatibility checking.

See [ExampleSuite.scala](https://github.com/xplosunn/statham/blob/main/src/test/scala/com/github/xplosunn/statham/ExampleSuite.scala) for a sneak-peak into the capabilities.
